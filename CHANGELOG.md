## [Unreleased]

### Added

- New `mtui-mcp` console script (optional `mcp` extra) ships a
  Model Context Protocol server, built on the official `mcp` Python
  SDK, that exposes every non-interactive mtui command as an MCP
  tool, plus dedicated `testreport_read` / `testreport_patch` /
  `testreport_write` tools, so LLM clients can drive a headless mtui
  session over `stdio` or `http`. The `mcp` extra installs
  `mcp[cli]>=1.2`; on openSUSE the SDK is packaged as
  `python3-mcp`. See `Documentation/mcp.rst` for the deny-list,
  per-client isolation model, and a `read → patch → read` worked
  example.
- `mtui-mcp`'s `http` transport now isolates session state **per
  client**: each connected client gets its own loaded test report and
  set of SSH hosts, keyed on the MCP session, so concurrent clients no
  longer share (or clobber) one another's `load_template` / `add_host`
  state and run without cross-session serialisation. The number of
  concurrent sessions is bounded by `[mcp] session_cap` (default 32)
  and idle sessions are reaped after `[mcp] session_idle_timeout`
  seconds (default 1800), disconnecting their hosts. `stdio` is
  unchanged (one process, one session).

### Changed

- Outbound HTTP calls (Gitea PR client, QEM Dashboard client, openQA /
  QAM Dashboard search) now share a single source of truth for the
  `(connect, read)` timeout and TLS-certificate-verification policy in
  `mtui.support.http`, replacing three independent, inconsistent
  copies. A new `[mtui] ssl_verify` option globally overrides
  verification (`true`/`false`, or a path to a CA bundle); when unset,
  each call site keeps its previous default. The Gitea client now also
  applies the shared request timeout (it previously had none).
- MTUI now requires Python 3.13 or newer (previously 3.11). The
  minimum supported interpreter, the packaging classifiers, and the
  `ruff`/`ty` configuration were all raised to 3.13, and the
  `typing-extensions` backport dependency was dropped now that
  `typing.override` is available in the standard library.
- `mtui-mcp` no longer accepts boot-time test-report or host flags
  (`-a`/`--auto-review-id`, `-k`/`--kernel-review-id`, `-s`/`--sut`);
  passing them now errors as unknown arguments. A single boot-time
  seed cannot belong to any one client under the new per-client
  isolation, so each client loads its own state at runtime via the
  `load_template` and `add_host` tools instead. (The REPL `mtui`
  keeps these flags.)

### Fixed

- `mtui-mcp` no longer paints the interactive `|/-\` spinner to
  stderr during long-running parallel actions (`run`, `set_repo`,
  `sftp_*`). The spinner is a REPL-only progress channel; over MCP
  the proper signal is `notifications/progress`. The REPL keeps its
  spinner unchanged.
- `mtui-mcp` now emits MCP `notifications/progress` every 10 seconds
  while a tool call is running, so spec-compliant MCP clients
  (Inspector, Claude Desktop, opencode, …) no longer time out on
  long-running commands such as `run`, `update`, `set_repo`, `commit`,
  slow `add_host`, or `load_template`. The heartbeat is automatic and
  applies to every auto-generated tool plus the three testreport
  tools; clients that ignore progress notifications can raise their
  own per-server timeout (see `Documentation/mcp.rst`).
- `run`, `show_log`, and `show_diff` now return their output when
  invoked through `mtui-mcp`. The three commands routed results through
  the interactive pager (`page()`), which early-returned in
  non-interactive mode and left the captured stdout buffer empty —
  MCP clients received an empty response instead of the per-host
  command output, log lines, or source diff. The pager now forwards
  each line to the caller's display sink in non-interactive mode while
  the REPL pager behaviour is unchanged. A latent
  `UnboundLocalError` in `run` when target locking failed is also
  fixed.
- `lrun` now captures child stdout/stderr and propagates the real exit
  code when invoked through `mtui-mcp` (or any non-interactive prompt).
  Previously a failing local command surfaced to the MCP client as
  `exit_code=1` with no output; the child's streams went to the server's
  TTY and `CalledProcessError.returncode` was discarded. The interactive
  REPL path is unchanged — output still streams live to the terminal.
- `openqa_overview` now shows build check logs for all packages in a
  multi-package update, not just one. Previously only logs matching a
  single package name extracted from the build string were displayed,
  causing build check results for other packages in the update to be
  silently omitted.
- `mtui-mcp` now exposes the full surface of `set_repo` and
  `load_template`. The previous schema-synthesis collapsed each
  command's mutually exclusive flag pair onto a single MCP parameter,
  silently hiding the `--remove` operation of `set_repo` and the
  `--kernel-review-id` path of `load_template` from clients (visible at
  boot as `duplicate dest` warnings). `set_repo` now takes a required
  `operation` enum (`add`/`remove`); `load_template` now takes two
  optional strings `auto_review_id` / `kernel_review_id` with an
  "exactly one required" runtime check.
- `mtui-mcp` now preserves real argparse defaults for optional
  list-shaped arguments. Previously the schema layer replaced every
  optional list default with `[]`, so invoking `openqa_overview`
  without `aggregated_groups` emitted a bare `--aggregated-groups`
  flag and crashed with *"expected at least one argument"*. Non-empty
  argparse defaults (like `["core"]`) now flow through to the MCP
  schema and match the REPL behaviour.
- `mtui-mcp` single-token positional commands now accept a scalar
  argument instead of a 1-element array. Affected tools: `set_location`,
  `set_log_level`, `set_timeout`, `set_host_state`, `put`, `get`.
  Previously the schema demanded e.g. `{"site": ["prague"]}` because
  the synthesis layer treated argparse `nargs=1` like `nargs="+"`,
  causing clients that sent `{"site": "prague"}` to fail with
  `Input should be a valid list`. The MCP schema now exposes these
  arguments as plain scalars while the underlying argparse layer is
  unchanged.
- `config show` with no attributes no longer crashes with
  `TypeError: 'ConfigOption' object is not subscriptable`. The handler
  was still indexing config entries as tuples after they were
  refactored into a `ConfigOption` dataclass, so any caller (REPL or
  `mtui-mcp`'s `config_show` tool) that omitted attribute names hit
  the error instead of getting the sorted option list.
- `mtui-mcp` now shuts down cleanly on Ctrl-C. The previous handler
  caught a bare `KeyboardInterrupt`, but the MCP server runs under
  `anyio.run`, which on Python 3.11+ wraps a Ctrl-C delivered
  to an active task group inside a `BaseExceptionGroup`. The group
  slipped past the handler and the user saw a multi-frame traceback
  instead of a graceful exit. The server now also catches
  `BaseExceptionGroup` instances whose leaves are all shutdown
  sentinels (`KeyboardInterrupt`, `SystemExit`,
  `asyncio.CancelledError`), logs a single `mtui-mcp: shutting down`
  line, and exits 0. Ctrl-C pressed during pre-server preload
  (`-a` / `-k` testreport load) or autoconnect (`-s` SUT loop)
  is handled the same way. Groups containing a real error still hit
  the existing crash path (`mtui-mcp crashed`, exit 1).

### Changed

- Non-interactive calls to `prompt_user` now return the ``default``
  argument instead of always returning ``False``. Callers that pass
  ``default=True`` (``load_template`` — overwrites an already-loaded
  session; ``updateid.py`` — deletes a checked-out template) now
  auto-confirm in non-interactive mode (MCP, scripts). All other
  callers pass no ``default`` and are unaffected. The docstring for
  ``prompt_user`` was updated to document this contract.
