Introduction
============

The MTUI shell is comparable to a bash shell as both use the readline
backend for command processing.

For all shell commands, autocompletion and line editing features are
enabled, as well as command history and history searching.

For a short overview of procedures and help texts, the ``help`` command is
also available (i.e. ``help add_host`` prints a short description of the
`add_host`_ command). Alternatively, you may use the ``--help`` argument (e.g.
``add_host -h`` or ``add_host --help``).

Running processes can be interrupted by pressing CTRL-C.
However, it blocks until all currently running commands have finished.


Common Argument Types
=====================

.. option:: -t HOST, --target HOST

  Address of the target host (should be the FQDN).

  In most cases ``-t`` is an optional argument; can be used multiple times, and
  if omitted, all hosts are used.


Commands
========

Host Management
***************

add_host
++++++++

::

  add_host [-t HOST]

Adds another machine to the target host list.
Without parameter adds all hosts from testplatform based on location


remove_host
+++++++++++

::

  remove_host [-t HOST]

Disconnects from given refhost(s) and removes them from the target host list.

.. warning::
  When used without parameters, the command removes all hosts.

  The host log is purged as well.

If the tester wants to preserve the log, the `set_host_state`_ command should be
considered instead, to set the host to ``disabled``.


list_hosts
++++++++++

::

  list_hosts

Lists all connected hosts, including the system types and their current
state: ``enabled``, ``disabled`` or ``dryrun``.


list_history
++++++++++++

::

  list_history [-e EVENT] [-t HOST]

Lists a history of MTUI events on the target hosts, such as installing or
updating packages. Date, username and event is shown. Events can be
filtered with the ``EVENT`` parameter.

**Options:**

.. option:: -e EVENT, --event EVENT

  Event to list: ``connect``, ``disconnect``, ``update``, ``downgrade``, ``install``.


list_locks
++++++++++

::

  list_locks

Lists lock state of all connected hosts.


list_products
+++++++++++++

::

  list_products [-t HOSTS]

Lists installed poducts on selected or all hosts.


reload_products
+++++++++++++++

::

  reload_products [-t HOSTS]

Refresh informations about installed products on selected or all host.


reload_openqa
+++++++++++++

::
  
  reload_openqa

Reload informations from openQA instances.


set_workflow
++++++++++++

::
  
  set_workflow {auto,manual,kernel}

Sets workflow and reload data from openQA.

'auto' workflow will be automatically set to manual if openQA install tests
missing or have failed state

.. option:: workflow

  one of supported workflows 


set_host_state
++++++++++++++

::

  set_host_state [-t HOST] state

Sets the host state to ``enabled``, ``disabled`` or ``dryrun``.

A host set to ``enabled`` runs all issued commands, while a ``disabled`` host or
a host set to ``dryrun`` doesn't run any command. The difference between
them is that on ``dryrun`` hosts, the issued commands are printed to the console,
while ``disabled`` doesn't print anything.

Additionally, the execution mode of each host can be set to ``parallel``
(default) or ``serial``. All commands which are designed to run in
parallel (such as the ``run`` command) are influenced by this option.

**Options:**

.. option:: state

  The desired host state: ``enabled``, ``disabled``, ``dryrun``, ``parallel``,
  ``serial``


lock
++++

::

    lock [-t HOST]

Locks host for exclusive usage. This locks all repository transactions, such as
enabling or disabling the testing repository on the target hosts.

.. caution::
  The hosts are locked with a timestamp, the UID and PID of the session.
  This influences the update process of concurrent instances. Use with care.

Enabled locks are automatically removed when exiting the session.
To lock the `run`_ command on other sessions as well, it's necessary to
set a comment.


set_timeout
+++++++++++

::

    set_timeout [-t HOST] timeout

Changes the current execution timeout for a target host. When the
timeout limit is hit, the user is asked to wait for the current command
to return, or to proceed with the next one. The timeout value is set in seconds.
To disable the timeout, set it to "0".

**Options:**

.. option:: timeout

  Timeout in sec; ``0`` disables it.


list_timeout
++++++++++++

::

    list_timeout

Prints the current timeout values per host in seconds.


unlock
++++++

::

    unlock [-f] [-t HOST]

Unlocks given targets. Unlocks all if used without arguments.

**Options:**


.. option:: -f, --force

  Force unlock - removes locks set by other users or sessions.


EOF
+++

::

    EOF [reboot | poweroff]

Reboots or shuts down the refhosts.

**Options:**

.. option:: reboot

  Reboots the refhosts.

.. option:: poweroff

  Shuts down the refhosts.


Update Management
*****************

install
+++++++

::

    install [-t HOST] package [package ...]

Installs packages from the current active repository.
The repository should be set with the `set_repo`_ command beforehand.

**Options:**

.. option:: package

  Package to install.


uninstall
+++++++++

::

    uninstall [-t HOST] package [package ...]

Removes packages from the system.

**Options:**

.. option:: package

  Package to uninstall.


prepare
+++++++

::

    prepare [-f] [-i] [-u] [-t HOST]


Installs missing or outdated packages from the regular UPDATE repositories.

This command is also run by the update procedure before applying the updates.

**Options:**

.. option:: -f, --force

  Forces package installation even on package conflicts.

.. option:: -i, --installed

  Prepares only installed packages.

.. option:: -u, --update

  Enables test update repositories and installs from there.


downgrade
+++++++++

::

    downgrade [-t HOST]

Downgrades all related packages to the last released version (using
the UPDATE channel).

update
++++++

::

    update [--newpackage] [--noprepare] [--noscript] [-t HOST]


Runs the `prepare`_ command and applies the testing update to the target hosts.
(To skip the preparation procedure, use ``--noprepare``.)

In classic workflow, while updating the machines, the pre-, post- and compare
scripts are run before and after the update process. During auto mode, scripts are
always disabled.
(To skip run of scripts use ``--noscript`` parameter.)

If the update adds new packages to the channel, the "newpackage" parameter
triggers the package installation right after the update.

Update uses internally the products structure from refhost. If this structure was
changed before an `update`_ please use `reload_products`_ command.

**Options:**

.. option:: --newpackage

  Installs new packages after update.

.. option:: --noprepare

  Skips the prepare procedure.

.. option:: --noscript

  Skips the pre- and post- scripts.


export
++++++

::

    export [-f] [-t HOST] [filename]

Exports the gathered update data to template file. This includes the
pre/post package versions and the update log. An output file can be
specified; if none is specified, the output is written to the current
testing template.

Refhost zypper installation logs are exported to subdir per refhost.

**Options:**

.. option:: -f, --force

  Force overwrite existing template and if openQA results are in log,
  download them again and replace older records.

.. option:: filename

  Output template file name.


Testing Commands
****************

run
+++

::

    run [-t HOST] command

Runs a command on a specified host or on all enabled targets.

The command timeout is set to 5 minutes, after which, if there is no output on
stdout or stderr, a timeout exception is thrown. The commands are run in parallel
on every target, or in serial mode when set with ``set_host_state``.

After the call is returned, the output (including the return code) of each host
is shown on the console. Please be aware that no interactive commands can be
run with this procedure.

**Options:**

.. option:: command

  Command to run on refhost.

.. option:: -R, --remove

  Removes issue repos from refhosts.


show_log
++++++++
