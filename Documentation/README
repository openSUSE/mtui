Maintenance Test Update Installer
==================================


Purpose
-------------------------

The Maintenance Test Update Installer (MTUI) automates common task in the
maintenance update process and provides handy shortcuts and commands
for update testing and verifying. While MTUI provides a framework for
testing, updating and reporting, the tester does not need to handle
different console terminals, hosts or package versions himself. The
tester could now focus on the bug and regression testing while leaving
most of the tools overhead behind. This should speed up the testing and
make the testing workflows better comparable. All issued commands are
stored for later processing, i.e. for completing the maintenance template
or for reference on subsequent updates.


Interface
-------------------------

Parameters
-------------------------

See cli.rst.

Configuration File
-------------------------

See cfg.rst.

Shell
-------------------------

See iui.rst.

User Scripts
-------------------------
In order to automate serveral steps the tester has done manually, MTUI provides
some hooks to include user scripts for i.e. setting up the system or checking
the system state. Some of these scripts are already available in the "helper"
subdirectory. See the README file in that directory for further reading on how
these scripts are working. In short: the scripts are copied over to the
template directory and are run when invoking the "update" procedure.
The scripts which are linked to the scripts/pre/ directory
are run before the update is applied. The tester should deploy own scripts to
$TEMPLATE_DIR/scripts. This makes sure that scripts which are specific to an
update are not run on all other updates as well. All scripts in the
scripts/post/ directory are run after the update was applied. To check if
there are any regressions introduced by the update, the scripts in
scripts/compare/ are run with the output from the pre and post scripts as
parameter. The compare scripts signal possible regressions with the return
code. MTUI shows this errors to the tester who hast to decide what to do with
the findings.

All scripts with the same name form a testing group. For instance, if the
tester wants to run a qa_ testcase for the update, he should write a script
which spawns the testcase on the hosts:

#!/bin/sh
/usr/share/qa/tools/cpio-run

This script (with the name check_cpio.sh) is then linked to
scrips/pre/check_cpio.sh and scripts/post/check_cpio.sh. Now, it's run before
the update and afterwards. The output is saved to
$TEMPLATE_DIR/output/scripts/[pre|post].check_cpio.sh.$hostname. When the post
scripts have finished, the compare scripts are run. They need to have the same
name ("compare" prefix instead of "check", though) as the check script.
In this case it's compare_check_cpio.sh.

compare_check_cpio.sh is run with the previous results as parameter:
compare_check_cpio.sh \
  $TEMPLATE_DIR/output/scripts/pre.check_cpio.sh.$hostname \
  $TEMPLATE_DIR/output/scripts/post.check_cpio.sh.$hostname

If there are some unwanted differences, the compare script should return 1.
Otherwise, return 0. If the script didn't get any sensible output, 3 may be
returned to indicate the script wasn't run.


Proposed Testing Workflow
-------------------------
Invoke mtui.py with the update RRID as parameter in interactive mode and set the
testreports directory if it's not already set by the TEMPLATE_DIR environment
variable or the configuration file.
The script connects then to the reference hosts mentioned in the template file.

The interactive shell is now loaded and ready. First the tester could check if
the correct package versions are installed. By running list_packages without
parameter, the package list with the required version numbers is shown. This
versions should be higher than the versions currently installed
(list_packages all).

If all packages are in a consistent state, the first testcase could be run. In
this case, the provides for the libraries are not correct. The output of the
run command could later be added as reproducer to the bug section of the
template.

When all bugs are reproduced (be it with MTUI or per direct login on the
reference host), the update process could be started. To get more information
on the update command, please see above.
In case of errors or warnings in the update process, the tester can stop the
process if he's asked for the next step and resolve these issues first before
running update again.

mtui > update
info: preparing
info: done... [\]
start pre update scripts? (y/N) y

start compare scripts? (y/N) y
info: preparing script compare_all_updated.sh
info: preparing script compare_vendor_and_disturl.pl

After the update, the package versions and the update log could be exported
to the template file for further processing.

mtui > export

To verify that the bugs are actually fixed, one can run the reproducers again.
In this case, the provides are fixed.

mtui > run rpm -q --provides libibmad1
libra.suse.de:~> rpm -q --provides libibmad1 [0]
libibmad = 1.2.3_20090314

For regression tests the run command could be used as well. For instance,
running a ctcs testcase with "run all,/usr/share/qa/tools/*-run".
Now the tester could add the reproducers, regression tests and their
output to the template file with the edit command and a little copy + paste.
The tester just needs to set the update state to PASSED or FAILED before
submitting the template to the SVN.

mtui > edit template
mtui > commit
Revision 6824.

When the testing is finished, "quit" exits MTUI and disconnects from the
remote hosts.
